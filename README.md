Billing and Stock Management System
===================================

This project is a web-based billing and stock management system for a small business/shop. It allows users to manage products, track inventory, create bills, and generate sales reports. The app supports different user roles (Admin and Cashier) to limit access based on permissions.

*   **Optional**: AJAX for real-time updates, Django REST Framework (for building APIs if needed)
    

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
    
*   **pip** (Python package installer) for managing dependencies.
    
*   **Git** for version control (optional but recommended).
    

### Steps

1.  Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/billing-and-stock-system.git
cd billing-and-stock-system
```
    
2.  It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```
python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate
```
    
3.  Use pip to install the required packages from requirements.txt.
   ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    

Database Setup
--------------

1.  Run Django migrations to set up the initial database structure.
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
    
2.  Create a superuser (admin) to manage the system.
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

3.  After logging in with the admin account, add products manually through the UI or by populating initial data.
    

Environment Variables
---------------------

Create a .env file in the root directory to store environment-specific variables (like SECRET\_KEY). 

Add the following line:
```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DEBUG=True
```


Make sure to replace your\_secret\_key\_here with a secure, unique key for your project.

Running the Application
-----------------------

1.  Run the Django development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
    
3.  Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the application.
    

Usage
-----

1.  **Admin Login**
    
    *   Use the superuser credentials you created during setup to log in as an Admin.
        
    *   Admin can add/edit products, view sales reports, and manage the inventory.
        
2.  **Cashier Login**
    
    *   Create a user account with limited permissions (cashier role).
        
    *   Cashiers can create bills, view product stock, and check prices but cannot manage the inventory or view reports.
        
3.  **Product Management**
    
    *   Navigate to the Product Management page to add new products or update existing stock.
        
4.  **Billing**
    
    *   Use the Billing page to generate bills. The system will automatically calculate totals and deduct sold quantities from the inventory.
        
5.  **Reports**
    
    *   Access the Reports section to view sales data by date range (Admin-only feature).
